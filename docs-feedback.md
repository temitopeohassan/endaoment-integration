# Documentation Feedback

### 1. Clarity and Understanding
- The documentation was clear and easy to understand. It made it possible to adapt to my code implementation


### 2. Completeness
- The documentation was complete for the purposes of the API integration 

### 3. Technical Accuracy
- The documentation gave a good technical insight to the requirements of using the API, allowing for the developer to implement the integration effectively.

### 4. Organization and Structure
- The documentation was well-organized, ensuring that the prerequired steps were implemented first, login and token transfer, before any other feature was attempted

### 5. Suggestions for Improvement
- There can be better type definitions. This does not affect everyone using the API as some may decide to use vanilla JavaScript, but in the TypeScript version used in the examples
- For the DAF creation form, the country is required to be submitted in a specified format. Either this is explicitly stated in the documentation, so that a drop down menu is used in the frontend application or country names can be accepted by the API
