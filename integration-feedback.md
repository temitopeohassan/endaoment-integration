### 1. Integration Process
- The Integration process was smooth and straight forward for the most part
- A couple of changes had to be made by the team during the week, but in general everything was okay

### 2. Technical Implementation
- The API was well documented, the only additional things I had to do on my end to ensure proper functionality was define types and implement CORS for form handling
- Also created a OAuth helper file to help me handle the log in as well as state management

### 3. Support and Resources
- The support offered during the process was timely and all required adjustments to ensure the completion of the process was made in a timely fashion
