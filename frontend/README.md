# Quickstart Frontend

This is a quickstart project for a frontend application using React with Endaoment integration.

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Copy the content of `.env.example` into a new file called `.env`
3. Run `yarn dev`
4. Ensure the backend is running at `http://localhost:5000` by following the instructions in the [`quickstart/backend/README.md`](../backend/README.md)

The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Visiting this URL in your browser will allow you to tinker with all the different flows available through the Endaoment DAAS API.
